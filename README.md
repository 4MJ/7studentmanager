# Introduction
Seven Advanced Academy Student Manager is a system that is build to manage the registration, profile, attendance, results, courses and status of students within the Seven Advanced Academy Institution. This system is build in such a way that a registered student has a personalised QR code which is scanned only by an authorised Admin. Once this QR code is scanned, the attendance of that student is registered and a statistic of his weakly, monthly, semestral and anual attendance can be calculated. Also, this system can allow the admistration manage the level, results, courses, projects and status of each and every student.

## Purpose and Aim:
This system is built with the aim of aiding the Seven Administration in better managing the records of their students digitally, without having to use papers in collecting attendence and calculating it before integrating it into the student results. Also It will help the School administration to view and be current with the various side projects students are doing which will go a long way in boosting their results.
